									<p>I began my data analyst journey after being in the food and beverage industry for over ten years. From there, I learned how to solve problems quickly and efficiently as well as the ability to communicate with differing backgrounds to achieve a common goal.</p>
									<p>A few interesting things about me. I love to create things that others enjoy, whether it be something I learned to do recently or something I've known how to do for years. I am also an avid gamer. I love to play strategy games, first person shooters, simulators and sports games. Lastly, I love broadening my pallete and exploring new places and things.</p>
									<p>I am highly motivated to constantly develop my skills and grow professionally. I am confident in my ability to learn new concepts and apply them to my clients to lead to future growth.</p></p>
